% 非线性塞德尔迭代法
% Input - G is the nonlinear system saved in the M-file G.m
%       - P is the initial guess at the solution
%       - delta is the error bound 
%       - max1 is the number of iterations
% Output- P is the seidel approximation to the solution 
%       - iter is the number of iterations required
